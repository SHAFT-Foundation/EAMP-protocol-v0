# Introduction to EAMP

EAMP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide accessibility context to both humans and AI agents. Think of EAMP like a USB-C port for accessibility - just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals, EAMP provides a standardized way to connect AI models and assistive technologies to rich accessibility metadata.

EAMP enables you to build accessible applications and complex workflows on top of existing content while preparing for the AI-agent economy where accessibility becomes a competitive advantage.

## What EAMP Provides

- **A growing list of pre-built integrations** that assistive technologies and AI agents can directly plug into
- **A standardized way** to build custom accessibility integrations for any application  
- **An open protocol** that everyone is free to implement and use
- **The flexibility to evolve** between different platforms while maintaining accessibility
